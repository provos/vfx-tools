Simple VFX Scripts
---

These are just some simple scripts I wrote for helping with basic VFX workflows.

- **convert-unreal-animation-to-houdini**: A Juptyer notebook to take clipboard data of an animation from Unreal Engine and export it for import into Houdini. This was needed to get proper root motion so that the character wasn't sliding. See [blog post](https://www.provos.org/p/netrunner-music-video/).
- **text-animation-example.py**: A python script for Nuke to generate animated text nodes for a lyrics video. Used in Activ8te's Patch Your Network track. See [blog post](https://www.provos.org/p/type-on-typewriter-animation-in-nuke/).
